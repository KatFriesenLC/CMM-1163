		A small mouse made their way out of the__(adjective)___(noun)___ and into the ___(adjective)___ Forest. They were desperate to find __(noun)__ because they were unbearably __(adjective)__ and needed to get to the __(noun)__ before they could rest.
	The most important part of their desperate task was to make sure they didn’t forget their __(adverb)__ __(colour)__  __(noun)__. Leaving it behind would leave them vulnerable to attack and they would have to __(verb)__ even further to prove to their __(noun)__ that they could be the
		
		__(dream)__ of the Forest.
	The mouse felt encouraged by their friends; Spider, Frog and Slug to follow their dreams and become the best __(dream)__ their forest had ever seen. It didn’t take long before they saw how __(adjective)__ they could become. This empowered them to inspire other forest creatures to make their home a stateless, moneyless society. It wasn’t until the snake emerged from it’s home a few __(measure of distance)__ away that the mouse began to feel disturbed again.
	As the snake approached, the mouse began to __(verb2)__ for home. They didn’t have time to make it up the tree so they __(verb3)__ towards his nest instead. As the leaves crunched beneath his tiny __(appendage)__, they listened close for where the snake was. They could hear the sounds of the forest floor being crushed under the belly of the hognose snake getting more and more quiet. Taking a breath, they emerged from their __(noun6)__ to check on their friends. 
		
		
	Spider had stuck himself between two __(plu)__, “I am too small for him to eat.” he assured the mouse. Mouse tripped over Frog hiding in the mud, “I was too __(emotion)__ to make it to the water.” he croaked. The mouse __(past tense verb1)__, __(past tense verb2)__, and __(past tense verb3)__ around the forest in search of his friend Slug. In circles and circles he __(past tense verb)__ until he felt a slimy thud. Mouse __(past tense verb)__ back in fear. His heart thudded in his chest. “What’s wrong, mouse?” asked slug. “I thought you were dead!” The slug shrugged __(adverb)__. I was just hanging out in the __(noun)__. The mouse thought about it for a moment… and noticed the silence. His ears __(past tense verb)__. “He’s coming…the __(noun)__ is coming”, the mouse whispered. The thunderous clap of the __(previous noun)____’s __(body part)__ sent the entire forest into __(state of being)__ and the mouse and his friends were never heard from again.
